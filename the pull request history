Congrats to the New England Patriots for winning the Super Bowl. And what a heartbreaker for fans of the Seattle Seahawks! But it was a very close game and it could have gone either way. Both teams have a lot to celebrate. Just like any good football team reflects on their accomplishments at the end of the season, the Bitbucket team has a lot to celebrate, too. So we thought it would be fun to look back at what we achieved together in 2014. Thank you for making 2014 our best year yet and here&#8217;s to making 2015 even better.

A tab called &#8216;Merged Pull Requests&#8217;
